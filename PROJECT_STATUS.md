# Project Status — NamasteVideo.ai

Last updated: October 1, 2026 (Asia/Kolkata).

This is the source of truth for development progress. Specifications describe intent; a feature is complete here only when its implementation and verification are recorded. Design approval is not evidence of working functionality.

## Current checkpoint

**F01 — Application scaffold: Done.** The isolated Next.js workspace and Cinema UI foundation pass the checks recorded below. Next feature: F02, MongoDB connection and schema/index setup (not started).

No application authentication, persisted projects, hosted rendering or Instagram integration exists yet. The local video pipeline predates the application and remains separately usable.

## How this document is maintained

1. Before coding, select one feature below and mark it In progress; identify its acceptance criteria.
2. Implement that feature without silently starting unrelated features.
3. Run relevant checks and record commands, results, date, and practical limits. Link files/artifacts rather than treating this document alone as proof.
4. Mark Done only when its acceptance criteria pass. Use Partial or Blocked when appropriate and explain what remains. Append the feature entry before reporting completion.
5. Update this document in the same change as every code/configuration addition or modification, including fixes to completed features. Keep the feature table and checkpoint consistent.
6. Commit and push each completed development step/milestone to [akshaymarch7/namaste-video-ai](https://github.com/akshaymarch7/namaste-video-ai). Verify the remote commit, and report any blocked/unpushed work. This is a standing user instruction, also recorded in AGENTS.md. Exclude credentials, generated video/audio, dependencies and build output.

Repository contributors follow this workflow through AGENTS.md. No external automation is implied; the document must be updated during development.

## Branch workflow

- `dev`: active development branch; completed steps/milestones are committed and pushed here.
- `main`: stable baseline, initially `dfe1883`. Finalized, verified changes are promoted through a pull request after explicit user approval to merge.
- This workflow is recorded in AGENTS.md; GitHub branch protection has not been configured.

## Feature backlog — build in order

| ID | Small feature | Status | Completion evidence required |

| F17 | Personal preferences UI/API | Planned | Timezone and future-project voice persisted without changing existing projects |
| F18 | Personal Instagram authorization | Planned | Official connect/callback, eligibility, reconnect/disconnect and owner isolation |
| F19 | Reviewed Post now flow | Planned | Exact asset/account/caption; confirmed publication; duplicate/unknown-outcome protection |
| F20 | Scheduling and schedule management | Planned | Timezone/DST/lead-time validation; durable dispatch; cancel/replace/reconnect races |
| F21 | Full Cinema homepage and cross-device polish | Planned | Complete approved homepage, deliberate hero motion, mobile/a11y review and real example playback |
| F22 | Internal end-to-end acceptance and deployment | Planned | Two-user isolation, outage/recovery checks, generation benchmarks, Meta test posts; deployment separately reviewed |

Infrastructure blockers are recorded against the affected feature. Do not move billing, public signup, teams or brand kits into V1 implicitly.

## F01 — implementation record

Scope: a runnable web application foundation, not the complete homepage or dashboard.

- `apps/web`: isolated npm workspace using Next.js App Router 16.3.8, React/React DOM 19.3.0, strict TypeScript, root layout and metadata.
- `apps/web/app/globals.css`: approved neutral Cinema tokens, responsive layout, visible focus, reduced-motion handling, shared control and panel styles.
- `apps/web/components/ui.tsx`: Brand, Shell, ActionLink and Button primitives.
- `/`: scaffold preview with the approved brand direction and a static story illustration; links to `/foundation`.
- `/foundation`: development specimens for colors, typography, controls and feedback; input is explicitly not saved. No false login or generation controls.
- Generic not-found and route error boundaries. Routes are public, contain no account data, and carry noindex metadata; noindex is not authentication.
- Local Fontsource packages serve fonts without build-time Google Fonts requests.
- `.nvmrc` selects Node 24.21.0. Host initially reports Node 25.2.1; all verification commands ran under Node 24.21.0.
- Root scripts delegate web dev/build/start to the workspace. Prototype dependencies and source are retained. Web React is separately versioned from prototype React 19.2.0.
- Root `public/runs` and `runs` are outside the Next.js app root. Never symlink them into the web app or use the root as a public server directory.
- Root `.env.local` remains prototype-only. No credentials were read or copied. Future web secrets belong in ignored `apps/web/.env.local`.

Architecture adjustment: SYSTEM_DESIGN.md's logical web `app/` and `components/` directories are located under `apps/web/` to isolate web static assets and runtime dependencies from the working Remotion prototype. The service/API design is unchanged.

### Verification

Verified October 1, 2026, locally:

| Check | Command or evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | `npm exec --yes --package=node@24.21.0 -- node --version` | v24.21.0 |
| Types and regression tests | `npm exec --yes --package=node@24.21.0 -- npm run check` | Prototype TypeScript, web TypeScript and all 23 existing tests passed |
| Production build | `npm exec --yes --package=node@24.21.0 -- npm run build` | Passed; `/`, `/foundation` and not-found routes generated |
| Production HTTP checks | [Recorded responses](design/verification/f01-http-checks.json) against `npm start` | `/` and `/foundation` return 200; unknown route, `/.env.local` and prototype MP4 path return 404; noindex present |
| Desktop UI | [Screenshot](design/verification/f01-desktop.png) | Cinema palette and two-column hero inspected; foundation link navigates correctly |
| Mobile UI, 390 × 844 viewport | [Home](design/verification/f01-mobile.png), [foundation](design/verification/f01-foundation-mobile.png) | Stacked layouts inspected; document width 375px within 390px viewport; no horizontal overflow; home link works |
| Browser console | Production preview after navigation and responsive checks | No captured warning/error entries |

The host Node 25 installation emitted the expected Node 24 engine warning; the commands above explicitly used the selected Node 24 runtime. No new paid API calls, video renders, external publication or deployment were performed. Existing pipeline tests validate local behavior, not live provider availability.

### Remaining limitations

- No database, auth, sessions, save operations, AI calls or media integrations in the web app.
- Homepage illustration is static; full homepage and motion are F21.
- The UI foundation page is a development specimen; it will be gated/removed before internal deployment.
- Error UI is present; failure injection verification is deferred until real server operations exist.

## Earlier evidence

The local pipeline history is retained in PROTOTYPE_STATUS.md. It records three generated videos, Gemini/ElevenLabs integrations, timing checks, and renderer recovery tests. Those historical results are not evidence that a hosted pipeline or dashboard works. Existing design artifacts remain in design/SCREEN_REVIEW_INDEX.md; the founder approved proceeding with implementation on October 1, 2026, with background colors normalized to the Cinema tokens.

## Change log

| Date | Feature | Change | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-01 | Branch workflow | Created `dev` from the published initial scaffold and made it the active development branch; documented milestone pushes to `dev` and approval before promotion to `main` | Clean starting tree; remote had no `dev`; documentation-only change, checked with `git diff --check`; remote branch equality verified at handoff |
| 2026-10-01 | Repository setup | Prepared initial public repository snapshot of the prototype, scaffold, specifications and design evidence; added standing milestone commit/push workflow | Remote confirmed empty; publishable text scanned for common credential patterns with no matches; environment and generated-media exclusions verified; F01 checks above remain applicable (no runtime code changed). Push result is verified against the remote and reported at handoff. |
| 2026-10-01 | F01 | Completed isolated Next.js scaffold, Cinema primitives, runtime configuration and status workflow | Node 24 production build, both typechecks, 23 tests, HTTP boundary checks and desktop/mobile review passed; evidence above |
